<p>Upgrading the backend is usually pretty straight forward. From the root directory of the backend run <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo bash maintence-scripts/upgrade.sh</code></p>

<p>If anything breaks you can try rebuilding the images as well <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo bash maintence-scripts/upgrade.sh -r</code></p>

<p><strong>TODO</strong> Add instructions for remote upgrade</p>
